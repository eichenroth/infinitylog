# Infinity Log

This is Infinity Log.

_There is still a lot of work to do._

## Why - What is the problem we are going to solve.

_This section needs attention!_

__I, personally, find note taking hard.__
There are multiple note taking solutions, but any solutions has its own flaws.

1. Advanced tools like evernote come with a rich featureset but they are overwelming.

1. The Problem of note taking does not seems so hard, that you need an extra tool.

1. The user needs to organize its data in tools.

## Philosophy

1. __There is just one log.__ Everything you write, you write in one consecutive log, that gets increasingly longer. There are no pages, there are no folders. Everything is flat.

1. __Do not care about structure.__ The text you write ist completely unstructured. The software should be able to find, sort, and structure the text.

1. __There is no formatting.__ _Maybe..._
